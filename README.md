# Discord Rich Presence for Plex

A Python script that displays your [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) status on [Discord](https://discord.com) using [Rich Presence](https://discord.com/developers/docs/rich-presence/how-to).

## Getting Started

1. Install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. [Download](archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the ZIP file containing the files in this repository
3. Extract the contents of the above ZIP file into a new directory
4. Navigate a command-line interface (cmd.exe, PowerShell, bash, etc.) to the above directory
5. Install the required Python modules by running `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Start the script by running `python main.py`

When the script runs for the first time, a `config.json` file will be created in the working directory and you will be prompted to complete the authentication flow to allow the script to retrieve an access token for your Plex account.

The script must be running on the same machine as your Discord client.

## Configuration - `config.json`
